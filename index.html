        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural
          abilities — must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from
          certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo
          finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day,
          after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon
          that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called
          the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the
          extremely rare ability to level up in strength and turn anyone he
          kills into a loyal minion called a shadow. Jinwoo then sets out on a
          journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and
          monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source
          of his powers.
